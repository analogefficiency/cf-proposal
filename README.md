# Assumptions

# Design Decisions
## Stack
**Golang: Jan 20, 2022**
- At first the intention was to go with a Springboot project; however, at present my current personal workstation isn't set up for it. While my experience with Go is quite basic, my personal machine is setup for it. Making the assumption that the time spent setting up / debugging is outweighed by leveraging existing capacity to start dev in go.

**Sqlite3: Jan 21, 2022**
- Relational db without much setup overhead, focus is MVP. 

**sqlc: Jan 22, 2022**
- Making up for lack of Go foundation using SQLC for boilerplate, db connections. Leverage existing SQL knowledge to focus time on weaker areas.

**Postman: Jan 22, 2022**
- Used for testing endpoints

**[DB Browser for SQL Lite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/): Jan 22, 2022**
- Used for confirming results on database.

## Data Model
[Data Dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lYeBe29FgTnOEaFF-xYTOj10ipwja7ZW6d8-eWqQOho/edit?usp=sharing)
```
01/22/2022 - Dates stored as INTEGER as Sqlite has no built-in date types. UNIX date seems the better route for 
             comparisons later.
```
```
01/23/2022 - Short URLS technically should be unique too. Updated dictionary.
```
## Trade-offs
1. A validator of some sort will be needed for the UrlDto payload; however, foregoing a validation layer until MVP is achived. Run risk of burning too many hours going into the different permutations for a URL and date. If time allows i'll circle around and add validation there. 
2. Passing database connection as a global variable. Would like to spend more time looking at implementing another pattern, but current implementation is working - will focus on remaining MVP items.
